# Implementation Progress

## Status
- [x] Requirements documented
- [x] Runtime call stack and review gate completed (Go confirmed)
- [x] Code changes applied
- [x] Tests executed and passing
- [x] Post-implementation docs sync decision recorded

## Implemented Changes
1. Updated `AgentTeamInstanceResolver` to resolve team definition metadata before writing team run manifest.
2. Fixed persisted manifest `teamDefinitionName` to use definition name (fallback to definition ID only when unavailable).
3. Fixed persisted manifest `coordinatorMemberRouteKey` to use definition coordinator mapping when resolvable.
4. Added resolver unit tests for:
   - correct manifest metadata in lazy-create flow,
   - fallback metadata behavior when definition lookup is unavailable.

## Verification
- Command: `pnpm vitest tests/unit/api/graphql/types/agent-team-instance-resolver.test.ts`
- Result: Passed (`4/4` tests)

## Docs Sync Decision
- No external `docs/` updates required.
- Rationale: behavior contract and architecture remain unchanged; fix is correctness for persisted metadata fields already intended by existing API semantics.
