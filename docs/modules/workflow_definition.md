# Workflow Definition (Removed)

## Status

This module is not active in the current `autobyteus-server-ts` codebase.

## Current Repository State

- `src/workflow-definition` directory exists as an empty placeholder.
- There is no active GraphQL type/resolver or service implementation for workflow definitions.

## Documentation Policy

- This file is retained only as a decommission marker.
- Active module documentation is tracked from `docs/modules/README.md`, which no longer lists workflow definition as a runtime module.
